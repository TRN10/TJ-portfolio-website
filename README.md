# <Trentan Jurkans portfolio website>


The purpose of this exercise is to create a portfolio webpage to showcase both ourselves and the skills and knowledge learned during bootcamp, with links to example of real projects that will be completed by the end of the course. For the purpose of the exercise links to google.com were used until they can be replaced with links to real projects.

This project is a consolodation of the skills learned so far in the course, with a focus on HTML and CSS. The code for this project was created from scratch. This exercise specified that the site be responsive and contain contact and about information. The site also needs to have navigation elements that link to relevant parts of the site, as well as links to other accounts such as Github and LinkedIn.

This project has been a real consolodation of all the HTML and CSS skills learned so far. Learning how to link to external sites and other areas of the page was something I needed to learn and apply to this project.
